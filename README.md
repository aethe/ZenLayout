If you have ever had to write Auto Layout constraints in code, you probably know how painful it could be sometimes. ZenLayout is a small but smart library which aims to simplify the layout related programming and make it both convenient and enjoyable.

### Disclaimer

ZenLayout is still under development, which means that until version 1.0.0 the compatibility with the previous versions of ZenLayout is not guaranteed. If you are using CocoaPods, consider specifying the desired version in the Podfile.
